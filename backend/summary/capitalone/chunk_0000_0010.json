In the scene, two men are standing in an office or similar professional setting. The atmosphere conveys a professional appearance, with adornments such as desks, chairs, a computer, and papers arranged in the workspace. The man in the foreground, whose face isn't visible as we can only see from his chin down to his midsection, is dressed in a t-shirt bearing "HACK" on it and has an ID badge fixed to his waist. Meanwhile, the man in the background, clad in a grey t-shirt and an ID badge around his neck, is fully visible and wears a slight smile.

Their conversation introduces themselves and their work. The man in the background starts, asking, "how are you, nice to meet you, how are you doing today?” to which the other replies, "I'm well, so what's your name?” After the man identifies himself as Barney, he reveals that the other man's name is Ishan. Barney then shows his curiosity, asking Ishan where he works. Ishan responds, "Capital One."

Interested, Barney inquires further about Ishan's role at Capital One. Ishan explains that his team works on a specific business topic at Wingstop, revealing, "my team is about small business and we are building a portal for small businesses, so that they can set policies and requirements for their employees." Barney ends the conversation with a simple and polite, "thank you", to which Ishan reciprocates with another "thank you."
