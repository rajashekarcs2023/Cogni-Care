In the scene, a young man is seen indoors looking slightly upwards to the camera as if he's engaging in a conversation with someone. He is wearing a grey t-shirt which carries a graphic that spells out "HACK", implying that he might be at some tech or hacking-related gathering. Encircling his neck is a lanyard with an ID card or badge, a usual sight at conferences or such events. The man is standing against the backdrop of a large glass window, presenting a view of an interior space, fitted with a counter displaying multiple boxes and what appear to be small flags, likely pertaining to the event's theme or organization. An "M" logo is also noticeable through the window, hinting at the name of the location or the organizing body.

The man is in the middle of a conversation where he's asked, "How are you? Nice to meet you. How are you doing today?" He responds, indicating that he is doing well, and introduces himself as Barney. The person Barney speaks to introduces himself, following which Barney is asked about his workplace. Barney shares that he works at Capital One and is asked to detail his role there. He explains that his role at Capital One entails working with a team on a 'small business topic.' They aim to build a portal for small businesses to facilitate setting policies and requirements for their employees. Barney's explanation is acknowledged, and he is thanked for sharing this information. He reciprocates by expressing his gratitude.
