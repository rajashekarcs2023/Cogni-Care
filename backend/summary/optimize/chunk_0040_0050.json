In the scene, a young man named Ishaan is sitting at a table with an open laptop in front of him in an informal, possibly academic or corporate environment. He is wearing a light-colored hoodie with the word "Optimize" printed on it and a lanyard with an ID tag. Expressively gesturing and looking directly at the camera, he seems to be in a conversation. He explains he's a sponsor for a company called Amoxicillin and is part of OptimEyes, the social Innovation Department at the University of Michigan. His role is to assist people in transforming social impact ideas into well-developed projects and businesses. Today, they are sponsoring a hackathon to help convert ideas into digital prototypes that can aid communities. 

On the other side of the table, there's a young woman wearing glasses and a light blue shirt, seemingly engaged in the conversation. Behind them, the background reveals an indoor public area or lobby, possibly a food court or pick-up area due to a sign indicating as such. The setting, likely a University or a business area, contributes a lively backdrop to their interaction. After completing his explanation, Ishaan thanks the woman, expressing satisfaction at their meeting before the scene ends.
