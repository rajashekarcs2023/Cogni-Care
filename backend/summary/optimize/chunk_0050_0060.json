The video scene takes place in a casual public space, possibly a university common area or a cafeteria, and showcases two individuals, a young man and woman, engaged in conversation at a table. The young man, notably wearing a light gray hoodie and an ID card on a lanyard around his neck, acts as the primary speaker, his hands outspread in an explanatory gesture. He introduces himself as Ishaan, and explains that he's a sponsor for Amoxicillin. Ishaan is affiliating with OptimEyes, the social Innovation Department at the University of Michigan, which helps individuals materialize their social impact ideas into tangible projects or businesses. Today, they are sponsoring a hackathon informing attendees to transform their concepts into digital prototypes that are purposed to assist communities. Seated opposite Ishaan is a young woman in a light blue hoodie and glasses, who appears to be absorbed in his explanation or something on her laptop, partially out of view. In the background, the environment is revealed to be spacious and ideal for gatherings or break times, as hinted by an orange staircase with a railing and rows of black foldable chairs stacked against the wall. After their conversation concludes, they exchange pleasantries before parting ways.
