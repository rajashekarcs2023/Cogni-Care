The scene shows two individuals seated within a spacious, naturally lit public indoor area, possibly a lobby or common area in a building such as a university or office complex – suggested by the "Executive Suite" sign visible on the stairwell in the background. The individuals are having a casual conversation, both wearing hoodies, one light blue with the word "OPTIMIZE" printed on it, indicating their association with OptimEyes - the social Innovation Department at the University of Michigan.

The foreground individual, with a friendly demeanor, short-cropped hair, and wearing a lanyard with an ID card, introduced himself as Ishaan. He mentioned that he's here as a sponsor representing OptimEyes for an event called Amoxicillin. Through his organization, they assist in transforming social impact concepts into substantial projects and businesses. On this day, they are sponsoring a hackathon aimed at helping people digitize their ideas into prototypes that can benefit communities. After sharing this information about OptimEyes and their involvement in the event, Ishaan and the unnamed individual wearing glasses, also looking towards the camera, say their goodbyes, ending their engaging conversation. The overall atmosphere of the scene appears casual and relaxed, with several black leather couches against the wall and the area being well-lit, suggesting large windows just out of frame.
