In the scene, two individuals wearing pale blue hoodies with the word "Optimize" printed on them are seated at a table indoors within a corporate-like setting that may be a university, conference center, or firm. The person in the foreground is a young man named Ishaan, looking directly at the camera with an attentive demeanor. His companion on the left is a visibly engaged young woman, also sporting glasses and a similar hoodie. 

The conversation between the two reveals they are at a public event, possibly a hackathon, where Ishaan's role is being clarified. He identifies as a representative from OptimEyes, the Social Innovation Department at the University of Michigan. Ishaan's team is known for aiding individuals to evolve social impact ideas into comprehensive projects and businesses. In this instance, they are sponsoring the hackathon with the aim of assisting attendees in transforming their concepts into digital prototypes for community help. 

The exact location of the scene remains slightly ambiguous, despite the visible sign reading "EXECUTIVE" above the background staircase. Nonetheless, the collected lanyards confirm the presence of an event or organization.
