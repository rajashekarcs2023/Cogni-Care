In the image, you can see two individuals sitting at a table. The person in the foreground is a young man wearing a light gray hoodie, speaking, and gesturing with his hands open as if he is explaining something. He has a lanyard with an ID card around his neck. Beside him is a young woman who appears to be listening or focused on something, perhaps a laptop that is not fully visible in the image. She is wearing a light blue hoodie and glasses.

They are indoors, and the setting seems to be a casual public space, possibly a university common area or a cafeteria, as indicated by the presence of an orange staircase with a railing in the background and rows of black foldable chairs stacked up against the wall to the right. The area seems spacious and designed for gatherings or breaks.
