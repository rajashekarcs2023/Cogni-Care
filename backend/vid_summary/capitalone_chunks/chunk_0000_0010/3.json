In this image, there are two men standing indoors, likely within an office or similar professional setting. The man in the foreground is wearing a t-shirt with the word "HACK" printed on it, and he is partially out of frame since we can only see from his chin down to his midsection; his face is not visible. He also seems to have an ID badge attached to his waist. The man in the background has a slight smile and is wearing a grey t-shirt; he is fully visible and also has an ID badge around his neck. The office environment includes typical elements such as desks, chairs, a computer, and papers. The lighting appears to be fluorescent, common in office buildings.
