This image shows a man sitting in what appears to be a public dining area or cafeteria. The man is wearing glasses, and a long-sleeved shirt that sports the University of Michigan logo, along with a basketball and the word "Michigan" written underneath. He has dark hair, a beard, and is smiling at the camera, and appears to be holding some food in his left hand. Around him, there are other people who are eating and walking. The white pillars and metallic structures suggest a modern architecture of the building. The atmosphere seems casual, typical of a university or corporate dining space.
