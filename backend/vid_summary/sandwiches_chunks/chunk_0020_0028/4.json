This image shows two individuals sitting in what appears to be a lobby or waiting area. The person on the left is moving, causing a slight blur, and he's holding a package, possibly food, in his hands. The person on the right is seated, holding a sandwich, and giving a thumbs-up to the camera, suggesting he's in a good mood or approving of the situation. Both individuals are smiling.

In the background, there's a glass door with the word "CAFÉ" written backward, indicating that the image is taken from inside looking out toward the entrance of the café. There are several notices attached to the door, and a blue arrow sign pointing to the right, although it's unclear what the sign indicates from this angle. The setting appears casual, with comfortable seating and natural light illuminating the space.
